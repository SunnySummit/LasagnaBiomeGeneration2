feel free to make your own changes. in order to distribute (paks or lua scripts) you must:
    1. provide full credits in a readme file included with the archive.
    2. use open (GPLv3) licensing and/or open nexus mods permissions (include these 5 points in the readme/description page).
    3. you cannot sell or profit from this mod.
    4. you cannot distribute this mod for other games or media besides No Man's Sky.
    5. don't re-upload these lua scripts verbatim, instead, link to this repo (or create a fork).
	
thank.
