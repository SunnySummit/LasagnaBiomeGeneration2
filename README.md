**compatible with:** worlds part 1

you might encounter issues with huge rocks. use custombiomes_med if it really bothers you.

i recommend installing all paks that start with three underscores, the others are optional.

feel free to make your own changes. in order to distribute you must:
1. provide full credits in a readme file included with the archive.
2. use open (GPLv3) licensing and/or open nexus mods permissions (include these 4 points in the readme/description page).
3. you cannot sell or profit from this mod.
4. you cannot distribute this mod for other games or media besides No Man's Sky.

credits can be found in the archive.
